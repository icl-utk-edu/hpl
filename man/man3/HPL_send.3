.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_send\fR
is a simple wrapper around  MPI_Send.  Its  main  purpose is
to  allow for some  experimentation / tuning  of this simple routine.
Successful  completion  is  indicated  by  the  returned  error  code
MPI_SUCCESS.  In the case of messages of length less than or equal to
zero, this function returns immediately.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
SBUF    (local input)                 double *
On entry, SBUF specifies the starting address of buffer to be
sent.
.TP 8
SCOUNT  (local input)                 int
On entry,  SCOUNT  specifies  the number of  double precision
entries in SBUF. SCOUNT must be at least zero.
.TP 8
DEST    (local  input)                int
On entry, DEST specifies the rank of the receiving process in
the communication space defined by COMM.
.TP 8
STAG    (local input)                 int
On entry,  STAG specifies the message tag to be used for this
communication operation.
.TP 8
COMM    (local input)                 MPI_Comm
The MPI communicator identifying the communication space.

.SH REPORTING BUGS
A  bug report consists of a short description of the problem,
minimally  including a description of  the  environment (name
and versions  of  the operating  system, compilers, libraries
used ...) .  When appropriate,  a short (less than 100 lines)
example program demonstrating the problem should be attached.
Such a report should be sent to the following e-mail address:
hpl@cs.utk.edu                                               
                                                             
Everything else, that you believe being a bug report as well,
will be handled as time allows.
