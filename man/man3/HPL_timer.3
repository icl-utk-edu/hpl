.SH NAME
HPL_timer \- Timer facility.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB\&#include <hpl.h>\fR
 
\fB\&void\fR
\fB\&HPL_timer(\fR
\fB\&const int\fR
\fI\&I\fR
\fB\&);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_timer\fR
provides a  "stopwatch"  functionality  cpu/wall  timer  in
seconds.  Up to  64  separate timers can be functioning at once.  The
first call starts the timer,  and the second stops it.  This  routine
can be disenabled  by calling  HPL_timer_disable(),  so that calls to
the timer are ignored.  This feature can be used to make sure certain
sections of code do not affect timings,  even  if  they call routines
which have HPL_timer calls in them. HPL_timer_enable() will re-enable
the  timer  functionality.  One  can retrieve  the current value of a
timer by calling
 
t0 = HPL_timer_inquire( HPL_WALL_TIME | HPL_CPU_TIME, I )
 
where  I  is the timer index in  [0..64).  To  inititialize the timer
functionality, one must have called HPL_timer_boot()  prior to any of
the functions mentioned above.
.SH ARGUMENTS

I       (global input)                const int

.SH REPORTING BUGS
A  bug report consists of a short description of the problem,
minimally  including a description of  the  environment (name
and versions  of  the operating  system, compilers, libraries
used ...) .  When appropriate,  a short (less than 100 lines)
example program demonstrating the problem should be attached.
Such a report should be sent to the following e-mail address:
hpl@cs.utk.edu                                               
                                                             
Everything else, that you believe being a bug report as well,
will be handled as time allows.
