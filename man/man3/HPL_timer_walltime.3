.SH NAME
HPL_timer_walltime \- Return the elapsed (wall-clock) time.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB\&#include <hpl.h>\fR
 
\fB\&double\fR
\fB\&HPL_timer_walltime();\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB\&HPL_timer_walltime\fR
returns the elapsed (wall-clock) time.
 
If HPL_USE_PentiumCPS  is defined to be the clock cycle per second on
an i[56]86 Intel processor (e.g., HPL_USE_PentiumCPS is defined to be
300  on a  300 Mhz Pentium processor), we read the internal processor
counters. Otherwise we use the  gettimeofday()  function that returns
the wall-clock time of the system (default).

.SH REPORTING BUGS
A  bug report consists of a short description of the problem,
minimally  including a description of  the  environment (name
and versions  of  the operating  system, compilers, libraries
used ...) .  When appropriate,  a short (less than 100 lines)
example program demonstrating the problem should be attached.
Such a report should be sent to the following e-mail address:
hpl@cs.utk.edu                                               
                                                             
Everything else, that you believe being a bug report as well,
will be handled as time allows.
