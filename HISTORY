 History

 - 09/27/00 A couple of mistakes in the  VSIPL  port have been
 corrected.  The tar file as well as the web site were updated
 on September 27th, 2000.  Note  that  these problems were not
 affecting the BLAS version of the software in anyway.

 - 01/01/04 Version 1.0a
 The  MPI  process grid  numbering  scheme  is now an run-time
 option.
 The inlined assembly  timer  routine that caused the compila-
 tion to fail when using  gcc  version 3.3  and above has been
 removed from the package.
 Various building problems on the T3E have been fixed;  Thanks
 to Edward Anderson.
