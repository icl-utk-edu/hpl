<H3>Errata</H3>

Due to a  couple errors  spotted in the  VSIPL  port  of  the
software,  the  distribution  contained  in  the  tar file of 
September  9th  has  been  updated on  September  27th,  2000
with a corrected  distribution.  <STRONG>These  problems were
not affecting in any way possible the  BLAS  version  of  the 
software.</STRONG>  If you are using  the  VSIPL port of HPL,
and  want  to  make  sure  you are  indeed  using  the latest
corrected version, please  check  the  date  contained in the
file HPL.build.log contained in the main directory.<BR><BR>

<H3>Reporting Bugs</H3>

A bug report  consists of a short description of the problem,
minimally including  a description  of  the environment (name
and versions  of  the operating system,  compilers, libraries
used ...).  When appropriate  a short  (less than 100  lines)
example program demonstrating the problem should be attached.
Such a report should be sent to the following e-mail address:
<A HREF = "mailto:hpl@cs.utk.edu">hpl@cs.utk.edu</A>.<BR><BR>

Everything  else,  that  you  believe  being  a bug report as
well, will be handled as time allows.<BR><BR>
