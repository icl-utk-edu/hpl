<H2>HPL Errata - Bugs</H2>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 1.0a, January 20th, 2004</H3>

The  MPI  process  grid numbering scheme defaults now to row-
major ordering. This option can now be selected at run time.<BR><BR>

The  inlined  assembly  timer  routine  that  was causing the
compilation to fail when using gcc version  3.3 and above has
been removed from the package.<BR><BR>

Various building problems on the T3E have been fixed;  Thanks
to Edward Anderson.<BR><BR>

<H3>Issues fixed in Version 1.0, September 27th, 2000</H3>

Due to a  couple errors  spotted in the  VSIPL  port  of  the
software,  the  distribution  contained  in  the  tar file of 
September 9th, 2000 had been updated on September 27th,  2000
with a corrected  distribution.  <STRONG>These  problems were
not affecting in any way possible the  BLAS  version  of  the 
software.</STRONG>  If you are using  the  VSIPL port of HPL,
and  want  to  make  sure  you are  indeed  using  the latest
corrected version, please  check  the  date  contained in the
file HPL.build.log contained in the main directory.<BR><BR>
