Gregory Bauer (UIUC) found a problem size corresponding to the
periodicity of the pseudo-random  matrix generator used in the
HPL timing program. This causes the LU factorization to detect
the singularity of the input matrix as it should have.
                                                                                
A problem size of  2^17 = 131072 causes columns 14 modulo 2^14 
i.e. 16384 (starting from 0)  to be bitwise identical on a ho-
mogeneous platform.  Every problem size being a power of 2 and
larger  than  2^15  will  feature  a  similar  problem  if one
searches far enough in the columns of the square input matrix.
                                                                                
The pseudo-random generator uses the linear congruential algo-
rithm: X(n+1) = (a * X(n) + c) mod m  as described in  the Art 
of Computer Programming,  Knuth 1973, Vol. 2. In the HPL case,
m is set to 2^31.
                                                                                
It is very important  to realize  that this issue is a problem 
of the testing part of the HPL software. The numerical proper-
ties of the algorithms used in the factorization and the solve
should  not  be  questioned because of this.  In fact, this is 
just the opposite: the factorization demonstrated the weakness
of the testing part of the software  by detecting the singula-
rity of the input matrix.
                                                                                
This  issue of  the testing program is not easy  to fix.  This 
pseudo-random  generator  has  very  useful properties despite 
this. It is thus currently recommended to HPL users willing to
test matrices of size larger than 2^15 to not use power twos.
