 List of the known problems with the HPL software

 Current as of release 1.0 - September 27, 2000
==============================================================
 Check out  the website  www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl  for the 
 latest information.

 1) Some  older  version  of the cxml  BLAS  library  seems to 
 require operands adresses  to be aligned on  64  or 96  bytes
 boundaries.  This error was tracked down to the  Level 2 BLAS
 DGER routine.  It is rather difficult to reproduce in a small
 example program since the operands  A,  X  and  Y  need to be
 stored at specific places in memory for the problem to occur.
 There are at least  4  possibles independent fixes  (applying
 one of them should be enough): 

 1. Get the latest cxml library.

 2. Do  not   use  the  right-looking  variant  of  the  panel
 factorization: Line 14 of the input data file HPL.dat  should
 not contain a 2. Use only 0s or 1s on that line.

 3. Link  in the  Fortran 77  reference implementation of that
 routine. Download the source from netlib and compile it. Move
 the object file  "dger.o"  into  the hpl/testing/ptest/<arch>
 directory.  Edit the  Makefile  there and add "dger.o" to the
 list of object files. Issue in that directory a  "make clean;
 make".  You  should  have  just  built  a  patched executable
 (hpl/bin/<arch>/xhpl).

 4. Another  possible fix that does not seem to always work is
 to set the value of the  ALIGN  parameter  in  the data input
 file hpl/bin/<arch>/HPL.dat to a multiple of 8 (or 12) larger
 than or equal to 8 (or 12).

==============================================================
 A  bug report consists of a short description of the problem,
 minimally  including a description of  the  environment (name
 and versions  of  the operating  system, compilers, libraries
 used ...) .  When appropriate,  a short (less than 100 lines)
 example program demonstrating the problem should be attached.
 Such a report should be sent to the following e-mail address:
 hpl@cs.utk.edu                                               
                                                              
 Everything else, that you believe being a bug report as well,
 will be handled as time allows.
